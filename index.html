    <p>Hello! I'm Rafael Ramirez,  I’m a Computer Science major at New Mexico State University. I am expected to graduate with my Bachelor of Science in CS in May of 2025. I will also be pursuing Master's degree in CS following my undergraduate degree.</p>
    <p>This portfolio website serves as a collage of some projects that I have recently worked on.</p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <h3>Here are a few of my recent projects:</h3><br>
    
    <a href="https://github.com/RafJRam/Discord-Bot">Discord Bot</a> - A Discord bot that maps text channel messages to keyboard strokes (insparation from <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tiktokplayspokemon_">tiktokplayspokemon</a>). <br><br>
    <a href="https://github.com/SarahDiazZ/FrostFyte_Project">FrostFyte</a> - A fighting game I worked on for CS 371 - Software Development. <br> I had worked on this on an old GitHub account. <br><br>

  <section id="POS">
    <h2>Point of Sale App</h2>
    <strong>Motivation:</strong> Our team, Carson Siegrist and I, had motivations to improve on the speed and accuracy of order creation within employees using POS systems.<br><br>

    <strong>Online Study:</strong> After auditing a selection of 10 popular POS apps, as well as scrapping through reviews of each app looking for common experiences and critiques, we had found that MANY POS apps seemed dated and/or clunky, and did lacked customization options. The flaw that stood out the most to us was the consistent layout of menu items and buttons being extremely vague and unintuitive. Some buttons, upon clicking, brought up a whole new layout of buttons that had to be "memorized", which tanks speed and accuracy. Our main improvement on this flaw was to change the styling of menu to radial menus, which we believed would show promising results.<br><br>

    <strong>Prototyping Phase:</strong> We started by creating 2 low-fidelity prototypes, using MS paint. We wanted one to closely resemble common POS models with standard menuing and vague icons and graphics. Our second model would showcase the main feature of radial menus per item. This was done so that we could conduct A/B studying on both prototypes to directly compare the user experience and efficiency of the different menu-stylings.<br><br>
    <strong>Study results:</strong> After conducting our A/B studying, which included observational qualitative notes, and a questionarre to gather performance data, we had found that radial menus, despite FEELING more intuitive and easier to use, had actually HINDERED the speed of the user creating and editing orders.<br>
    We believe there exists a bias here, seeing as how radial menus are not found among the top POS apps. With more trials and a more refined implementation, we believe radial menus can eventually outperform and become the next iteration of POS apps. Nevertheless, our final prototype stuck with the standard model of POS apps. <br><br><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t84GcdIGumsYDvPQpJRYmsKvc9GvjiIB/view?usp=drive_link">Short demo</a> prepared by Carson.
